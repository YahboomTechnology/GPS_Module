# Introduction
The GPS module is a high-performance positioning and navigation module based on ATGM336H-5N. It supports BDS system in China, GPS in UAS, GLONASS in Russia, and QZSS in Japan. It can simultaneously receive the signals of the above satellite navigation systems and realize joint positioning. It has a π-type antenna circuit, the impedance matching is 50Ω, the antenna standing wave ratio is lower than 1.6, the search signal ability is strong, and the positioning is more accurate. On-board Type-C and USB can be connected to common development boards such as computer, Raspberry Pi, Jetson, etc. Yahboom will provide ROS-related tutorials and source codes for users.
# Features
* Support four satellite systems(BDS, GPS, GLONASS, QZSS).
